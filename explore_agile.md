# Explore Agile Methodology

## What is Agile software development?

## What is an agile project?
    - Project that has iteration of pieces
    - Team meets once very 1-2 weeks
    - Makes sure everyone is on track
    - Meet w/ client to make sure they're on board with project features

## What is the definition of agile methodology?
    - Movement against traditional project management processes
    - "Waterfall"

## What is a sprint in Scrum?

## Is agile part of scrum?
    - Agile is a philosophy/idea of software dev/project management
    - Scrum is a type/application of the agile philosophy

## What is the most popular Agile methodology?
    - Scrum!
    - Used primarily for software development with goal of delivering new features 
    every 2 to 4 weeks

## What is the scrum board for?
    - Visually tracking which items need to be completed for the current sprint. 
    It has different columns, traditionally: To Do, Work In Progress, Done/Completed
  
## What is Scrum programming?
    - the most popular framework for implementing agile
    - an iterative and incremental agile software development framework for 
    managing product development
    - it defines a flexible and holistic product development strategy where a 
    development team works as a unit to reach a common goal and challenges the 
    assumption of the traditional sequential approach to product development. 
    - a key principle is recognizing that the customers can change their minds 
    about what they want and need, 
    during product development (often called requirements volatility), 
    and that unpredicted changes cannot be easily addressed in a traditional 
    predictive or planned manner
    - scrum adopts an evidence-based, empirical, approach - accepting that the 
    problem cannot be fully understood or defined,
    focusing instead on maximizing the team's ability to deliver quickly, 
    to respond to emerging requirements and to adapt to evolving technologies 
    and changes in market conditions
    - has a commitment to short iterations of work      
    - it enables teams to self-organize by encouraging physical co-location or 
    close online collaboration of all team members, 
    as well as daily face-to-face communication among all team members.

## How many phases are there in Scrum?
    - (http://scrummethodology-org.etltools.net/scrum-phases.html)
    I. THE PREGAME PHASE
        1. Planning: Creating a backlog/list of necessary properties that need
            to be implemented during the development process
            - Product Owner is responsible
                - Info from customers, situation on the market, competitors, which 
                functions/properties are most needed
            - Other points to discuss: 
                - Delivery date, functionality of release, important releases, list of 
                    backlog items, team structure, tools, risk control, release cost
        2. System Architecture/High Level Design:
            - Team reviews backlog, think of changes that need to be made
            - Refine old product
            - Learn additional knowledge
            - Solve problems that have come up in the process
            - Review meetings for exchanging info/present progress & problems
    II. THE GAME PHASE 
        - 'Sprint' or development phase
        - iterative cycle of development work (avg: 1-2 wks, maybe up to 4wks)
        - (http://scrummethodology-org.etltools.net/scrum-phases.html)
        1.  Develop
                - Analyze current situation (~ done by 'product owner')-->
            - Design the process (create Spring Backlog/User Stories/To-Do List)-->
            - Develop, implement, test, & document changes
        2.  Wrap-closing packets
                - wtf idk.
        3.  Review mtgs for:
                - Present current work
            - Resolve problems
            - Add new backlog items
            - Review risks
        4.  Adjust
                - Consolidate everything from review mtg into affected packets
    III. THE POSTGAME PHASE
        - "Closure" phase
        - Management ends the development process
        - Product is prepared for release 
        - Phase includes: integration, testing, user documentation, training,
            marketing material prep
          
    - (http://www.scrumstudy.com/WhyScrum/Scrum-Phases-And-Processes)
    I. Initiate - This phase includes the processes related to initiation of a project: 
    Create Project Vision, Identify Scrum Master and Stakeholder(s), Form Scrum Team, 
    Develop Epic(s), Create Prioritized Product Backlog, and Conduct Release Planning.

    II. Plan and Estimate -This phase consists of processes related to planning and 
    estimating tasks, which include Create User Stories, Approve, Estimate, and Commit 
    User Stories, Create Tasks, Estimate Tasks, and Create Sprint Backlog.

    III. Implement - This phase is related to the execution of the tasks and activities 
    to create a project's product. These activities include creating the various 
    deliverables, conducting Daily Standup Meetings, and grooming (i.e., reviewing, 
    fine-tuning, and regularly updating) the Product Backlog at regular intervals. 

    IV. Review and Retrospect - This phase is concerned with reviewing the deliverables 
    and the work that has been done and determining ways to improve the practices and 
    methods used to do project work.

    V. Release - This phase emphasizes on delivering the Accepted Deliverables to the 
    customer and identifying, documenting, and internalizing the lessons learned during 
    the project.
    
## What is a scrum meeting?
    - A daily, 15 minute, stand up, meeting held at the same time and location to discuss : 
        (1) any progress made since the last scrum meeting (yesterday), 
        (2) the tasks to do before the next scrum meeting (tomorrow), 
        (3) and any blockers that will slow/stop progress.

## What is the scrum master?
    - Person responsible for ensuring SCRUM is understood and enacted by the scrum team
    - Organizes and communicates with team
    - Manages scrum board 
    - Manages GitHub (pull requests, merging branches, etc.)

## What is a stand up meeting?
    - Team members meet and address: 
        1. What did you do yesterday?
        2. What did you do today?
        3. What are some obstacles you're facing? 

## What is velocity in Scrum?


## What is the product backlog?
    - Prioritized list of necessary features
    - Ordered top to bottom (level of importance)

## What does a product owner do?
    - Usually the project's key stakeholder
    - Team is grouped together by product owner having a strong vision
    - Communicates to the team members
    - Communicates to client(s)
